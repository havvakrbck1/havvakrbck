# 👋 Hi, I'm Havva!

I'm a passionate mathematician turned software developer, with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Marmara University and an Associate's degree in Computer Programming from Atatürk University.

After transitioning into tech, I’ve strengthened my technical skills through hands-on courses on platforms like BTK Academy and Udemy — diving deep into Angular, JavaScript, C#, .NET, Python, and MySQL. I'm especially enthusiastic about backend development and data analysis.

With strong analytical thinking, I enjoy solving complex problems and building efficient, scalable solutions. During my time as a Software Developer Intern at IFIN Services, I had the chance to apply my technical skills, collaborate effectively in a team, and adapt quickly in a fast-paced environment.

I’m a lifelong learner, currently working on improving my English (B2 level) and expanding my tech stack. My goal is to contribute to an innovative and dynamic team where I can grow as a developer and deliver meaningful results.

📍 Based in Istanbul, actively learning and building every day.
